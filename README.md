This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic dataset containing information about employees in a company. The objective is to uncover patterns and relationships between key variables such as years of service, salary, and department.  

The notebook walks through data loading, cleaning, transformation, visualization, and interpretation — following real-world data analysis workflows.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – for statistical graphics and styled plots

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Cleans and preprocesses employee data  
- ✅ Removes null values and duplicate records  
- ✅ Adds new calculated columns (e.g., net salary)  
- ✅ Visualizes relationships using:
  - Scatter plots (e.g., Salary vs. Years of Service)
  - Boxplots (e.g., Salary or Years of Service by Department)
  - Heatmaps (correlation between numerical variables)

## 📈 Visualizations

All plots are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, with appropriate titles, labels, and styling for presentation.
